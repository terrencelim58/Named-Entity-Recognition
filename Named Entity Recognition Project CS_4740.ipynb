A primer on this task is provided further on.  We will treat this as a **sequence-tagging task**: for each token in the input text, assign one of the following 5 entity labels -- **ORG** (Organization), **PER** (Person), **LOC** (Location), **MISC** (Miscellaneous), and **O** (Not Named Entity) -- as well as a BIO-format prefix **B-** (token is the *beginning* of a named entity) or **I-** (token is *inside* a named entity). Overall, this yields 9 different labels: **B-ORG, I-ORG, B-PER, I-PER, B-LOC, I-LOC, B-MISC, I-MISC** and **O**.\n",

Thus, k must be greater than 0.\n",

[nltk](https://www.nltk.org/book/ch05.html)) that process sentences and identify parts of speech. If you end up using a library to extract parts of speech tags or other features, please indicate this in your asnwer to Q3.1.\n",
